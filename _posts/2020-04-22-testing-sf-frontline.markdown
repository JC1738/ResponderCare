SF begins offering free coronavirus tests to all essential workers at 2 city sites. “Our goal is for every San Francisco resident who has symptoms of COVID-19 to have access to testing,” Mayor London Breed said in a statement.  “We want to ensure all front-line and essential employees that leave their homes every day to serve our residents have a fast, easy and accessible option for testing.”
